Welcome is this new section in which I will lead you step by step in the process on creating a plot in R. Let's dive in!

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

As you can see, we have the first 6 lines of you dataset. That is what we call the head. 

```{r}
attach(mtcars)
plot(mpg, hp, col="red", pch=20, xlab = "Miles per gallon",
     ylab = "Horsepower", main= "Horsepower vs MPG")
```
